Given the price i had to pay for this food (324 rupees for ONE biryani) they could have done much better than what i got. The biryani was dry. Medium flavoured. The rice was not frangrant.\\n\\nI was asked to choose one among - Mint chutney or gravy. I needed to pay more if i wanted both !.. Even a place that would give 80 rupee biryani provides both of this accomplaints.\\n\\nThe packaging was good but only half of the box was biryani. Other half was chutney and jamoon.

In this meal, u will get paneer gravy, Plain dal, White rice, 3 phulkas, curd, pickle, onions and 1 pakoda. To begin with, I will say the phulkas were soft and nice. It goes well with both the gravies. Dal was watery though!! Rice also goes well with both the gravy's, but it tastes better with Paneer gravy. Paneer pieces were not soft. It was a little hard. Curd tasted nice! Instead of pakoda, they cud have given some small dessert like jamun or kheer etc. Nevertheless, it was average fare for the night. Don't have complaints though.

Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.\")]",

You get 2 parotha in one plate the size of it is also quite adequate . You get chutney and saguu with it . The chutney is quite normal the saguu was good ,it was filled with veggies and right amount of spice .\\n\\nThey had filter coffee and a young kid was making it , so the coffee decoction to milk ratio was a little of but you can tell him how of it you want and he'll put that much .\\n\\nThe place is quite small and can seat about 10 people and another 10 can stand and eat with tables So not much of an ambeince .\\nThe place is clean though .\\nThe prices are quite nominal the price one plate parotha was 30 bucks .\\n\\nOverall a pretty good old styled darshini .\")]",
